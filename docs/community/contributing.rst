Contributing to Batavia
=======================

If you experience problems with Batavia, `log them on GitHub`_. If you want to contribute code, please `fork the code`_ and `submit a pull request`_.

Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------

The process of setting up a development environment is very similar to
the :doc:`/intro/index` process. The biggest difference is that
instead of using the official PyBee repository, you'll be using your own
Github fork.

As with the getting started guide, these instructions will assume that you
have Python 3.4, and have virtualenv available for use.

Batavia codebase
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by `forking Batavia`_ into your own Github repository; then
check out your fork to your own computer into a development directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir batavia-dev
    $ cd batavia-dev
    $ git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/batavia.git

Then create a virtual environment and install Batavia into it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv -p $(which python3.4) env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ cd batavia
    $ pip install -e .

*For those using anaconda*:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd batavia
    $ conda create -n batavia-dev
    $ source activate batavia-dev
    $ pip install -e .

Install Node.JS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lastly, you'll need to install `Node.js`_. You need to have a recent version
of Node; we test using v6.9.1. Once you've installed node, you can use it to
install Batavia's Javascript dependencies, and compile the Batavia library:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ npm install

.. _Node.js: https://nodejs.org


Raspbian/Raspberry Pi
"""""""""""""""""""""""

This has been successfully tested on Raspbian GNU/Linux 7 (wheezy), based on
instructions from `Procrastinative Ninja`_ and `aeberhardo`_.

Raspbian for Raspberry Pi 1 does not come with Python 3.4.  (Ubuntu 16.04 for Raspberry
Pi is now available, and has new enough packages as described above.) To install Python
3.4, download the source code and then build it:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cd /tmp
	$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.4/Python-3.4.4.tgz
	$ tar xvzf Python-3.4.4.tgz
	$ cd Python-3.4.4/
	$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/python3.4
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

Running the test suite
----------------------

You're now ready to run the test suite! In the ``batavia-dev/batavia`` directory, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test

This will take at least 20 minutes, and can take upwards of 1.5hrs, on most modern PCs/laptops,
and will generate around 10000 lines of console output - one line for each test that is executed.
Each line will tell you the pass/fail status of each test - e.g.,::

    test_abs_not_implemented (tests.builtins.test_abs.AbsTests) ... expected failure
    test_bool (tests.builtins.test_abs.BuiltinAbsFunctionTests) ... ok

This indicates that tests have passed (``ok``), or have failed in an expected
way (``expected failure``). These outcomes are what you expect to see. If you
see any lines that end ``FAIL``, ``ERROR``, or ``unexpected success``, then
you've found a problem. If this happens, at the end of the test run, youâ€™ll
also see a summary of the cause of those problems.

If you see "ERROR" press ctrl-c or cmd-c to quit the tests, and then start debugging.

However, this *shouldn't* happen - Batavia runs `continuous integration`_ to
make sure the test suite is always in a passing state. If you *do* get any
failures, errors, or unexpected successes, please check out the
`troubleshooting section <#troubleshooting>`_ or get in touch, because you
may have found a problem.

.. _continuous integration: https://travis-ci.org/pybee/batavia

If you just want to run a single test, or a single group of tests, you can provide command-line arguments.

To run a single test, provide the full dotted-path to the test:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.datatypes.test_str.BinaryStrOperationTests.test_add_bool

To run a full test case, do the same, but stop at the test case name:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.datatypes.test_str.BinaryStrOperationTests

Or, to run all the Str datatype tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.datatypes.test_str

Or, to run all the datatypes tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.datatypes


Troubleshooting
---------------

- If you copied the main Batavia code a while ago, please make sure your forked branch is up to date with the original branch. To do this:

  - set your upstream remote::

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/pybee/batavia.git

  - make sure you have the latest changes from upstream::

    $ git fetch upstream

  - rebase your **master** branch to **upstream** before pushing to GitHub and submitting a pull request::

    $ git rebase upstream/master
